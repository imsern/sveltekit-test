                Hello! I'm Kristoffer Ims Knutsen, a passionate web developer with a focus on creating dynamic and responsive websites. My development journey began in August 2021, and since then, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks.
            </p>

            <p class="text-home-body mb-6">
                Currently, I specialize in Java, HTML, CSS with SCSS, and JavaScript, working to craft seamless user experiences across the web. In addition to front-end technologies, I work with MySQL for database management and utilize frameworks like jQuery and Apache Velocity to build efficient and scalable web applications.
            </p>

            <p class="text-home-body mb-6">
                I am currently part of the team at Gurusoft AS, where I've been contributing my expertise since May 2022. Outside of my professional work, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge. In my free time, I experiment with modern web development frameworks like Svelte and Vue to stay ahead of the curve and further enhance my skill set.
            </p>

            <p class="text-home-body mb-6">
                My goal as a developer is to create intuitive, high-performance websites that not only meet client needs but also push the boundaries of what's possible on the web. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out if you'd like to collaborate on exciting projects!
